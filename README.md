# Codility-1

This JavaScript function evaluates two numbers, providing a concise comparison and returning an informative string result â€“ whether the first number is greater than, smaller than or equal to the second.

## Code Utilization

`console.log(compare(8, 3));   // "8 is greater than 3"
console.log(compare(-2, -8)); // "-2 is greater than -8"
console.log(compare(2, 2));   // "2 is equal to 2"
 `
